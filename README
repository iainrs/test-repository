# Files created for "REST APIs with Flask and Python" course run by Jose Salvatierra

## it was an excellent (Udemy) course which covered
- Object Oriented Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Git
and more to come.

As a bystander I haven't used  Git/GitHub before so it's very good experience and I will be using it for my own projects

Thanks Jose and Li
